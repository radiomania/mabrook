INSTALLATION

Move the uno.tcl script and the configuration file uno.cfg to your eggdrop
scripts directory and add a line to the end of your bot's config file:

source scripts/uno.tcl

You will want to edit uno.cfg to suit your liking. Be sure to at least set the
channel in which Uno will play. Note that the channel name is case sensitive and
should be defined as the channel appears in your bot's conf or chan file. The other
configuration items should be self-explanatory. Scores reset monthly at midnight local
time on the first day of each month, and a copy of the previous month's scores is saved.

Rehash your bot and type !uno to start the game. To get a listing of the
available commands, type !unocmds in the configured uno channel.
