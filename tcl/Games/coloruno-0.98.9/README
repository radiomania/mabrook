Uno(tm) is Copyright (C) 2001 Mattel, Inc.

This is a simple uno game that I wrote for eggdrop-1.6. It plays much
like other uno bots, responds much faster, makes use of color, has play
shortcuts, and the robot player wins games ;-)

Bot commands:

 !unocmds 	command list
 !remove [nick] remove [nick] (or yourself) from the current game
 !unowon [nick] show score for [nick]
 !unotop10 	top10 scores
 !unotop10 21	top10 blackjack winners
 !unotop3last   last month's Top3
 !unofast 	monthly fastest game record
 !unohigh 	monthly high score record
 !unostats	this months records
 !unorecords 	all-time records
 !uno 		start an uno game
 !stop 		stop uno

 Removing someone other than oneself is limited to channel ops.

Commands during play:

 jo	join an uno game
 od	show current playing order
 ti	show current game running time
 ca	re-display and sort cards in hand 
 pl	play a card
 cd	show current top card
 tu   	show whose turn it is
 dr	draw a card
 co	change color
 pa 	pass to next player
 ct  	show how many cards each player has left

Enjoy,
Marky
